To do list:

1. Build up the rectified linear circuit.
2. Save the pre-trained models
3. Build out a system to access pre-trained models in case you want to save memory.
4. Build out a data visualization system or just the usual one to display the data.

5. Extend the model... to a linear regression fit for pricing adding standard noise.
6. Use the model to predict the prices and tag it on to the predicted prices.
7. Use your indicators to generate buy and sell signals with the newly generated data set.
8. This concludes the technical thing.
