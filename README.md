## Vhagar Project Prototype

<p align="center">

**The project summary is as follows:** 

* This is a quick repository to serve as a public display of the Vhagar project.
* It is designed to use a machine learning system to quickly produce an alpha generate buy-sell signals.
* This Github repository is to show I have immediate machine learning engineering skills.
* This is an on-going project with the complexity rising as more development time can be contributed to this project.
* The ultimate goal of this project is to produce an general platform data insight analysis tool to generate buy and sell signals for securities focusing on nano-float securities. 
* The app should be designed and implemented in PyQT.

## The following are some samples that demonstrate the machine learning capabilities of the vhagar project.
